    "Most open source projects make great use of build scripts and build automation, because it makes it far easier for more contributors to participate on a project. For example, many Linux tools, to get the very latest version, require you to \"build from source,\" but this is easier than you might expect due to the build scripts.  Take a look at the process for building the CPython interpreter from source (you'd just need to clone the repo).
