This game was created specifically so I could practice and learn python.

This game is for educational purposes for myself, so the story I stole from Blizzard's Diablo 1 game

I've learned alot about python during this excercise, I hope to continue to develop this game into a playable text based "Diablo Clone" as I learn more python

Currently: I am working on Alpha_2.py version of Diablo Retrograded

This text adventure game was created using the following resources:
# https://www.makeuseof.com/python-text-adventure-game-create/ - basic text adventure that I heavily modified to build the game
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRWToxwgIjI - simple rpg module that I added and heavily modified as well
    -> https://valtyrtriit.blogspot.com/2022/01/python-3-win-7-rpg-systems-simple-level_26.html
# Jarulf's Guide for Diablo and Hellfire (using stats, math, character info currently and will be using even more information from this for future implementations)

Not yet implemented:
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBtcJdKAkgM - simple rpg Battle system
# Look into implementing curses (python)
# Finish ChurchLvl1, go to ChurchLvl2
# spells and spell levels for the sorceror
# Inventory system
# Gold system
# Loot system (randomly generated item pool?)
# Monster system
    -> mobs generated as per dungeon level
    -> Boss fights
# NPC interactions like:
    -> shops
    -> quests
# more character stats for battle system tied to the currently developed character stats/simple rpg system:
    -> Armor Class
    -> Hit Points
    -> Mana Points
    -> Damage / To Hit %
